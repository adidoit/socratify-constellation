      Welcome to your first blog post! This template shows you how to create 
      engaging content using the YAML-driven content system. Each post is a 
      simple YAML file that gets rendered as a beautiful, SEO-optimized page.

  - type: paragraph
    text: |
      YAML is human-readable and easy to write. Unlike traditional CMS platforms,
      your content lives in your codebase, making it version-controlled and 
      deployable with your app.

  - type: list
    style: numbered
    items:
      - No database required for content
      - Full version control with Git
      - Easy to edit and review in PRs
      - Deploy content with your code

      You can use various content block types to structure your articles:
      paragraphs, headings (h2, h3), images, blockquotes, lists, and videos.

      Now that you understand the basics, try creating your own blog post.
      Just add a new YAML file to the content/blog directory and it will
      automatically appear on your blog index page.
