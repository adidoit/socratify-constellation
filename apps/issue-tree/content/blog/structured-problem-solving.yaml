      You've probably met someone brilliant who makes terrible decisions. Or watched a genius flail when faced with a messy, ambiguous problem. Intelligence helps, but it's not the whole story.

  - type: paragraph
    text: |
      The difference between good and great problem solvers isn't IQ—it's process. Structured problem solving is a learnable skill that multiplies whatever brainpower you bring to the table.

    text: The trap of intuition

  - type: paragraph
    text: |
      Smart people often trust their intuition too much. They pattern-match quickly, reach a plausible answer, and move on. But complex problems punish this approach.

  - type: paragraph
    text: |
      Intuition works great for problems you've seen before. It fails spectacularly for novel situations, where your past experience actively misleads you.

    text: What structured problem solving looks like

  - type: paragraph
    text: |
      Structure doesn't mean bureaucracy or slow thinking. It means having a deliberate process for decomposing problems, generating hypotheses, and testing assumptions.

  - type: list
    style: numbered
    items:
      - Define the problem precisely—what would success look like?
      - Break it into component parts using frameworks like MECE
      - Prioritize which parts matter most to the answer
      - Develop hypotheses for each key component
      - Gather data to test your hypotheses
      - Synthesize insights into a clear recommendation

    text: Why structure beats brainpower

  - type: paragraph
    text: |
      A structured approach has two huge advantages. First, it's auditable—you can see where your logic might be wrong. Second, it's improvable—you can get better at each step over time.

  - type: paragraph
    text: |
      Unstructured thinking is a black box. When you get the wrong answer, you don't know why. When you get the right answer, you can't reliably repeat it.

    text: Getting started with structure

  - type: paragraph
    text: |
      The best way to build this skill is practice. Take a problem you're working on and try to decompose it into parts. Ask yourself: are these parts MECE? What am I missing?

      IssueTree is designed to be your practice partner. It helps you build the muscle memory of structured thinking until it becomes second nature.
