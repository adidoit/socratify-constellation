  subtitle: MECE stands for Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive—a principle that ensures your analysis covers everything without redundancy.

      If you've ever tried to solve a complex problem and felt like you were going in circles, you're not alone. The challenge isn't usually a lack of effort—it's a lack of structure.

      MECE (pronounced "me-see") is a framework that fixes this. It forces you to break problems into parts that don't overlap and together cover everything. No gaps, no redundancy.

    text: Mutually Exclusive means no overlap

  - type: paragraph
    text: |
      When your categories are mutually exclusive, each item belongs to exactly one bucket. There's no ambiguity about where something fits.

  - type: paragraph
    text: |
      For example, if you're analyzing a company's revenue sources, "Product Sales" and "Service Revenue" are mutually exclusive. But "Product Sales" and "US Sales" are not—a product sale in the US would be counted twice.

    text: Collectively Exhaustive means no gaps

  - type: paragraph

      Your categories must cover the entire space. If you're analyzing all possible causes of a problem, you shouldn't be able to point to a cause that doesn't fit any category.

      This is where many analyses fail. It's easy to list the obvious factors and miss the ones that matter most.

    text: How IssueTree helps you think in MECE

  - type: paragraph
    text: |
      Building MECE frameworks is hard. Your brain naturally wants to think in overlapping, incomplete ways. IssueTree's AI acts as a thinking partner that challenges you to fill gaps and remove overlaps.

  - type: paragraph
    text: |
      Start with a question, and IssueTree helps you decompose it into MECE sub-questions. Each branch is checked for completeness and exclusivity, so you can trust your analysis.
