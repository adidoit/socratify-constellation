# Ideas

- Chat Assistant can suggest edits to the tree (create changes at specific nodes that user can manually approve each)
- versioning like git / ability to see history of tree and go back
- Gallery (tied to the challenge feature?). Gallery shows pre-made interesting issue trees from different domains (match with socratify domains)
