  title: Architecture Diagrams That Actually Communicate
  subtitle: Stop making diagrams that confuse. Start making diagrams that clarify.

      We've all seen them - architecture diagrams that look impressive but leave 
      everyone more confused than before. Boxes everywhere, arrows pointing in 
      every direction, and no clear story being told.

    text: |
      Great architecture diagrams aren't about showing everything. They're about 
      showing the right things to the right audience at the right level of detail.

    text: The Problem with Most Diagrams

  - type: paragraph
    text: |
      Most architecture diagrams fail because they try to do too much. They show 
      every component, every connection, every detail - and in doing so, they 
      communicate nothing.

  - type: list
    style: bullet
    items:
      - Too many boxes (everything is "important")
      - Inconsistent abstraction levels
      - No clear reading order
      - Missing context about what matters

    text: A Better Approach

  - type: paragraph
    text: |
      Start with a question: What decision does this diagram need to support? 
      That single question will guide everything else - what to include, what 
      to leave out, and how to organize the visual hierarchy.

    text: Three Levels of Architecture Diagrams

  - type: list
    style: numbered
    items:
      - "Context: How does the system fit into the bigger picture?"
      - "Containers: What are the major deployable units?"
      - "Components: How is a container organized internally?"

  - type: paragraph
    text: |
      Pick one level per diagram. Mixing levels is the fastest way to create 
      confusion.
