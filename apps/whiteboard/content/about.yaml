      about complex systems. No feature bloat, no distractions - just a roomy canvas

      Most whiteboard tools try to do everything. We focus on architecture diagrams 
      and system design. This means a cleaner interface, better defaults for technical 
      drawings, and AI-powered critique that understands software architecture.
